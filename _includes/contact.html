					<p class="text-muted small-text">
					My name is Karolina Soltys and I'm a software engineer moonlighting as a game designer. I am dreaming of someday making game design my full-time job. Larps are my passion verging on obsession, and with Arsenic & Lies I am hoping to introduce larping to people who haven't tried it before. I co-organise <a class="link" href="https://immersivistlarps.wordpress.com/">The Immersivist Club</a>, a group regularly playing larps in London, and <a class="link" href="https://the-smoke.org/">The Smoke</a> – a larp festival taking place in London every January. I've also designed and organised a couple of weekend larps: <a class="link" href="http://ourlastyear.org/">Our Last Year</a> and <a class="link" href="https://thecastlelarp.weebly.com/">The Castle</a>, and co-organised the 2019 UK run of <a class="link" href="https://jall2019.weebly.com/">Just A Little Lovin'</a>.</p>

					<p class="text-muted small-text">
					Arsenic & Lies is inspired by some great games: <a class="link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3zTBqEISNMuZlQ5cGh1LVBtVlE?usp=sharing">Unheroes</a> by Joanna Piancastelli and <a class="link" href="https://www.fmlarp.com/">Fairweather Manor</a> by Dziobak Studios – I do recommend you check these out, they are a great introduction to larps. And, of course, my teenage love for Agatha Christie novels, and more recent binging on Downton Abbey.<br /><br />
					The artwork on cards is public domain; the cover artwork was created by myself with touch-ups by <a class="link" href="https://www.deviantart.com/rivoclavis">Oliver Nøglebæk</a>. The larp is in no way endorsed by Downton Abbey or the Agatha Christie estate and does not use any content from these works – they are just inspiration.</p>
